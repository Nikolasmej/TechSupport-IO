WOW!That sounds odd. Could you describe that problem in more detail?

OH!No other customer has ever complained about this before. What is your system configuration?

OH!That sounds interesting. Tell me more...

WOW!I need a bit more information on that.

OH!Have you checked that you do not have a dll conflict?

WOW!That is explained in the manual. Have you read the manual?

OH!Your description is a bit wishy-washy. Have you got an expert there with you who could describe this more precisely?

WOW!That's not a bug, it's a feature!

OH!Could you elaborate on that?
